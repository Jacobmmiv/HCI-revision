# Design Principles

## Human Centered Design

- A focus on designing things to be centered on how they would be used.
- Must always have a novice User Interface in mind.
- Observations on how people interact with the interface on an unconscious level.
- Interviews can help isolate specific needs of an interface.
- Empathize with the user's inability to use an interface, synthesize your findings.
- **Define - Ideate - Prototype - Test - Empathize**

## Principles of Visual Communication

1.  **Proximity:** Elements should be in close proximity with related elements.
2.  **Alignment:** Elements should follow an alignment to signify order and visual connection.
3.  **Repetition:** Repeating visual aspects to signify connection or importance.
4.  **Contrast:** Elements should be visually distinct if they need to stand out.

Following these principles will make the UI easier to use.

## Heuristic Evaluations

### Heuristic Rules

H1. **Visibility of System Status**  
H2. **Match between System and Real World**  
H3. **User Control and Freedom**  
H4. **Consistency and Standards**  
H5. **Error Prevention**  
H6. **Recognition rather than Recall**  
H7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**  
H8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**  
H9. **Help Users Recognize and Recover from Errors**  
H10. **Help and Documentation**

### Heuristic Evaluation Report Structure

- **Problem:** Describe the problem.
- **Heuristic:** Name and number of the Heuristic.
- **Severity:** 0 to 4 on how severe, frequency, impact, and persistence (Just put the number).
- **Fix:** A description of a solution on how to fix the problem.

**MEMORIZE THE HEURISTIC RULES!!!**

## Colour

- **Hue:** Dominates the spectrum.
- **Saturation:** How much it dominates.
- **Value:** The total light there is.
- This color profile uses these 3 parameters to determine the resulting color.
- Often used in design applications.

### RGB

- Red, green, blue.
- Every other color is a combination of these.
- Each primary color can have a value from 0 - 256, meaning there are 16,777,216 possible colors.

### CMYK

- Combination of every color.
- Black is represented by a key.
- This color profile is subtractive as it is only used in printing with pigments and dyes.

### Considerations When Using Colour

- Accessibility due to deficiencies.
- Older users may need more contrast.
- Deficiencies can range in severity (e.g., inability to see one of the RGB colors).

### Mistakes to Avoid

- Too many bright colors.
- Saturated complementary colors.
- Giving priority to hue instead of value and saturation.
- Visual inconsistency (e.g., red for delete buttons, deep blue text

## Lo-fi Prototypes

- Interactive prototypes to test quickly and functionality.
- These can be made with Figma to make wireframes.

### 4 Phases

1.  Brainstorm
2.  Sketch
3.  Lo-fi Prototype
4.  Test then Iterate

### Brainstorming and Sketching

- Come up with as many ideas as possible.
- Sketching allows better evaluation of validity.
- Sketches should meet a list of requirements if there are any criteria.

### Testing

- Testing is done in 4 stages:
    - Prepare a test scenario.
    - Conduct the test to encourage users to think out loud.
    - Debrief with a set of questions on their thoughts of the prototype.
    - Evaluate and create a report on the most important findings.
